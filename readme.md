# Godot Mono/.NET Install Script for linux

Adapted from [SingingBush/godot-fedora.md](https://gist.github.com/SingingBush/a16ef4bc8b94f57d3aa0e74d9c358d24).

## Prerequisites
Mono
- [Debian-based instructions](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin)
- Arch: `mono`
- Fedora: `mono-devel`

## This script only works for v4.2.1 and acts as a first time as it downloads and icon and creates a launcher.
I hope to make this work as an update script as well.
